  <h1>History</h1>
<p>Farmers in Calama,woke up totheir farm animals dead in their pens and mutilated. No one had known what or who did this.
  Fast, a rumor spread that this creature was known as El Chupacabra.</p>
<p>What is El Chupacabra?</p>
<p>Many say the the Chupacabra is a mix between a vampire and lizard.
  It has become a hot topic amongst cryptozoology.
  Cryptozoology is the study of animals that may or may not exist.
  No one has ever caught one of these creatures, but many have claimed to have seen it.
  Descriptions include, bulging red eyes, fanged teeth, a reptilian body and a long tongue.</p>
<p>Over time, the description of the Chupacabra has changed in some parts of the world and remained the same in other.
Some new descriptions categorize the Chupacabra has a hairless dog with long fangs. This description is similar to the
  older one, but emphasizes the creature's dog like shape.</p>
<p>More and more evidence has been uncovered as time has passed, and we have even found evidence ourselves as we have
  tackled to find this mystery creature. If you would like to see our evidence of our experience with the Chupacabra,
