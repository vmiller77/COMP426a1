  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Welcome to our website on El Chupacabra.
     We seek to find valid and interesting evidence on the Chupacabra's existence.
     On our site you will see real photos caught of the Chupacabra, along with other media
     proving its existence.</p>
  <p> We also have contact information as well if you would like to send us
     any evidence you have found. Click on the Contact tab to see further information.</p>

  <p>The Chupacabra is mythical to many, but we are out to prove them wrong
     with our evidence.</p>
